# Image Deepfake Detection

Image Deepfake Detection is a robust web application designed to detect manipulated images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images for analysis.
- **CNN Analysis:** Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model to analyze uploaded images.
- **Classification:** Determines whether the uploaded image is genuine or a deepfake.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:** Select an image file to upload for analysis.
2. **Analysis:** Wait for the system to complete the analysis process.
3. **View Result:** See the classification result indicating whether the uploaded image is genuine or a deepfake.
4. **Repeat:** Continue analyzing additional images as needed.

## Disclaimer

This project is developed for educational and research purposes and should not be solely relied upon for critical applications. While efforts have been made to provide accurate results, the system may have limitations and may not detect all deepfake images. It is recommended to employ multiple layers of verification for critical scenarios.
